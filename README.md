<h1>Recycling System - CM20314</h1>
<h2>A Short Explaination</h2>
<p>Recycling has many problems in today's world - we aim to identify the root causes and tackle the problems by creating niche solutions the world can benefit from.</p>
<p>So far we have identified a few key issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A lack of motivation for recycling</li>
  <li>Limited knowledge on how to recycle correctly</li>
  <li>A substandard awareness for the reasons for recycling</li>
</ol>
<h2>Our Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>We currently aim to alleviate the subpar knowledge on how to recycle correctly with an education game targeted for children.</p>
<p>Our game will include up to date and accurate information invaluable in teaching children the necessities that will allow them to recycle correctly and efficiently - building them a better tomorrow.</p>
<h2>Current Reflection on our Solution</h2>
<h3>Current works in the area </h3>
<p>We are aware of a few attempts to solve the problems we aim to solve in a similar fashion.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Recycle Roundup - National Geographic Kids https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/games/action-adventure/article/recycle-roundup-new </li>
  <li> Reduce Reuse Recycle Game - Turtle Diary https://www.turtlediary.com/game/recycling-waste.html </li>
<ul>
<h3>Where we aim to improve</h3>
<p>Most games fail to educate on the variability of recycling systems we use in the UK. Some places have 2 bins, some require sorting into 5 bins (Glass, aluminium/metal, Plastic, General Waste, Compost). The lack of reflection of this in these mainstream games means most will struggle adapting what they have learnt to real life. This will therefore have an impact on how much they recycle, as uncertaincy of correction will push them to the safe option of general waste.</p>
<p>Our solution will aim to educate as much recycling nuance as possible (in a manner suitable for children). While making learning fun, we aim to be able to teach children every which way of how to recycle correctly! No matter the recycling system they will have to use, or how obscure and technical the waste is.</p>
<p>Lastly, we aim to demonstrate why waste must be recycled. An increased awareness on what happens later down the process will incentivise recycling, knowing what they are doing has a direct impact on the world they live in. This point is also scarsely seen in online recycling games we have looked at.</p>
